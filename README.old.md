# INFO 340 Project

This repository contains code for an interactive information web app, created for the _Client-Side Web Development_ course at the UW iSchool.

## Travel Website/Review
This website is aimed to create a platform where users can search for flights and prices, directly compare 2-3 destinations by price, distance, and other components, and create their own travel bucket list. 

This README shall be updated in time as more of the site is completed/improved. 

Code is done in HTML, CSS.

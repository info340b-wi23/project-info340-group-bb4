          <h2>Problem/Data Domain</h2>
        </header>

        <ol>
            <li>Provide an overview of the general topic or question of interest (e.g., "what is meant by 'homelessness' and why is it a particular problem in Seattle?").
            </li>
                <p>Our general topic of interest is to better support people who want to travel by providing real and useful user-based reviews of the travel locations that are free from the commercial influence of travel agencies. 
                </p>
            <li>Identify an information technology problem in that space (e.g., "what information problems related to homelessness are unaddressed?").
            </li>
                <p>One information problem involved is that most travel websites are endorsed by travel agencies so the information people see from the website can be in favor of certain commercial entities. This information can lead people who want to travel to places, including hotels, restaurants, and landmarks, that are pricey and less enjoyable. Thus, we want to create a website that will show useful travel information based on the past travelers to guide future travelers having an enjoyable trip. 
                </p>
            <li>Identify at least 1 previous or existing attempt to solve this problem (e.g., "what other web apps attempt to address homelessness? What has already been tried?")
            </li>
                <p>One existing website we found is <a href="https://www.expedia.com/">Expedia</a>, a commonly used travel website that has features to book hotel, flight, and car rental. Even though Expedia has a section that provides information on <a href="https://www.expedia.com/things-to-do/search?d1=2023-01-27&d2=2023-01-28&endDate=1%2F28%2F2023&location=Las%20Vegas%20%28and%20vicinity%29%2C%20Nevada%2C%20United%20States%20of%20America&pwaDialog=&rid=178276&sort=RECOMMENDED&startDate=1%2F27%2F2023&swp=on">“Things to do”</a>, it does not provide reviews based on real travelers. In this case, our topic of interest will be helpful for travelers who want to visit places with user-based advice.

          <h2>Problem/Data Domain</h2>
        </header>

        <ol>
            <li>Provide an overview of the general topic or question of interest (e.g., "what is meant by 'homelessness' and why is it a particular problem in Seattle?").
            </li>
                <p>Our general topic of interest is to better support people who want to travel by providing real and useful user-based reviews of the travel locations that are free from the commercial influence of travel agencies. 
                </p>
            <li>Identify an information technology problem in that space (e.g., "what information problems related to homelessness are unaddressed?").
            </li>
                <p>One information problem involved is that most travel websites are endorsed by travel agencies so the information people see from the website can be in favor of certain commercial entities. This information can lead people who want to travel to places, including hotels, restaurants, and landmarks, that are pricey and less enjoyable. Thus, we want to create a website that will show useful travel information based on the past travelers to guide future travelers having an enjoyable trip. 
                </p>
            <li>Identify at least 1 previous or existing attempt to solve this problem (e.g., "what other web apps attempt to address homelessness? What has already been tried?")
            </li>
                <p>One existing website we found is <a href="https://www.expedia.com/">Expedia</a>, a commonly used travel website that has features to book hotel, flight, and car rental. Even though Expedia has a section that provides information on <a href="https://www.expedia.com/things-to-do/search?d1=2023-01-27&d2=2023-01-28&endDate=1%2F28%2F2023&location=Las%20Vegas%20%28and%20vicinity%29%2C%20Nevada%2C%20United%20States%20of%20America&pwaDialog=&rid=178276&sort=RECOMMENDED&startDate=1%2F27%2F2023&swp=on">“Things to do”</a>, it does not provide reviews based on real travelers. In this case, our topic of interest will be helpful for travelers who want to visit places with user-based advice.

    <!-- App Description -->

          <h2>App Description</h2>
        </header>

        <ol>
            <li>Who are the users of the application? That is, who will be accessing the website? What impacts might this app have on minority groups?
            </li>
                <p>The users of this application will be people who travel and want realistic reviews on the environment and/or price points of the places they are visiting. Since travel agents usually hold this kind of information but are generally expensive to get, this application will help users who also are on a lower budget for their travels. However, this application will not be super useful to those who cannot afford to travel.
                </p>
            <li>What will the users do with the web app? What kind of interactive features are you expecting to provide? Remember that you app will need to include at least "two and a half" significant features; be sure to explicitly identify and explain what all of them are!
            </li>
                <p>In the web app, users will be able to access three key features: a search and filter for locations, a review section for their own travels/seeing other people’s experiences, and a personal bucket list where they can save their future travels. First, the search and filter feature will allow users to search for certain locations they want to travel to and filter through different countries, price ranges, (<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ibrahimelsayed182/plane-ticket-price">see dataset here</a>) and general reviews from other users who have already traveled there, . Users will be able to decide from these filters which travel destinations will be the best for their tastes or budgets. Next, users who are done traveling can upload their experiences to the app, describing their personal experiences through a rating system and comments, and adding in their travel expenses to help others understand what price point this location is. Lastly, users can save different locations into their personal bucket list on their profile and check them off after travels, creating a little travel journal for them.</p>
            <li>What kind of information will the users be viewing? If you're drawing data from an external source (a csv file or an API), include a link and citation to that data.
            </li>
                <p>Since this app is based on users' experiences, the data that users will be viewing is from other users. However, for the sake of this project, we are looking for a dataset(linked above) that will give us the prices of different flights to global destinations to create existing user data for our web app. </p>

            <li>How will using this app help to solve your chosen problem? That is, how is it a solution to the problem you described?
            </li>
                <p>This app will help solve our problem because it provides a more realistic and less-biased view of traveling without a travel agency or agent. Also, since our app will not be sponsored by any travel companies or plane corporations, all reviews reflect true experiences of real people, giving our users much clearer expectations and a better travel experience.</p>
